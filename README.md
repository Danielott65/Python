#This code is used to configure a remote Cisco device
#Specifically this code changes the vlan of a device from 
#a VLAN that has no internet access to one that does 
#this code changes the VLAN from whatever it was to VLAN10 
#assuming the previous VLAN had no internet access and VLAN 10 does
#you can change the VLAN ID to whatever works for you
#for example if the VLAN that has internet access in your environment is VLAN 50
#just change VLAN10 -> VLAN 50
